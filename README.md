# Machine Learning linear regression using gradient descent algorithm

This simple script was made in order to understand how ML alorithms works.
It has also option for calculating new theta with regularization parameter.

- #### Hypothesis function
	For hypotheshis function there is linear regression aswell as polynomial regression.

**Data set** used for this example contains house pricing.

Andrew's Ng course which I used while writing this algorithm can be found on this website: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning to which I encourage you cordially.
